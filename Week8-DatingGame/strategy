Dating Game Strategy:

Person:
Start with randomm weights.
As the matchmaker guess a correct positive feature, reduce the weight of that feature.
Distribute  the change to all positive weights.


Matchmaker:
First Guess: the best performing initial random candidates. (Just to get the best score saved for the first time...)
Next Guess:
Gradient descent on the sammples from 20 to current guess.
Next candidate <- updated weights
If next candidate  ==  previous candidate:
	Generate 10_000 random candidates which maximizes the covarience of the data matrix. (To explore more)
