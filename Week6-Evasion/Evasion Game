Evasion Game:

Prey:
	Try to go to the center of the convex hull enclosing you, while avoiding hunter. If hunter is close by move perpendicular to hunters approach direction.
Hunter:
	if in the next move hunter will align with prey in horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or c-diagonal, then build the corresponding wall in this move.
	if the number of lines are close to limit, 
		check after bouncing a wall
			can you move this wall further inside, If yes remove this wall and wait until the alignment happens.
		if not bounced but still need to remove a wall,
			Find the lines limiting the prey's space, remove the rest.

	Check all the rounds if stuck between two diagonal walls
		if yes, remove them.

	Check every round if prey and hunter are in the same constrained space:
		if there is a line dividing the space, remove that line.
